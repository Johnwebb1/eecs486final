This file must work to preprocess the tweet selection.
Preprocessing must include:
- Cleaning tweet of punctuation, and emojis (tokenize)
- Dealing with Hashtags (complete-guide-to-twitter-sentiment-analysis-part-one)
- Dealing with tagged users (@'s)
- Dealing with non english tweets (remove using textblob or langdetect)
